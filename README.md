# Library App

## Project Overview

### Description

This is a back to basics project designed to exercise my knowledge of fundamental JS principles. In this case Object Constructors.

This objective is to create a simple front end app using plain JS and HTML that stores a library of books. Users should be able to add and remove books as well as edit if they have been read or not.

## Development

Sometimes when we work with libraries and frameworks we can often forget the simple things. That's one of the reasons why I decided to do this simple app. It served to exercise and remind myself of some basic concepts as well as reminding myself on how to create sites using basic, vanilla HTML, CSS and JS.

Yes it's simple and small but it did the job in jogging my memory.
