# Library App

## Project Overview

### Description

This is a back to basics project designed to exercise my knowledge of fundamental JS principles. In this case Object Constructors.

This objective is to create a simple front end app using plain JS and HTML that stores a library of books. Users should be able to add and remove books as well as edit if they have been read or not.
